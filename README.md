### Process: Installation and Building the Application

#### 1. Install {rhino} and Set Up the Environment
To begin, you'll need to install the `{rhino}` package, which helps you build interactive web applications using R, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

1. **Install the Necessary Packages**  
Open your R console or RStudio and run the following commands to install the required packages:

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rstudio/rhino")
```

2. **Load the Package**  
Once installed, load the `{rhino}` package into your R session:

```r
library(rhino)
```

#### 2. Build the User Interface Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

With `{rhino}`, you can use a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and customized user interface.

1. **UI Layout Using HTML and CSS**
   I integrated HTML Template into the Shiny App Using htmlTemplate() and connected UI and Server by {{ placeholder }} because of ull control over the UI, advanced styling, and interactivity. For example below, I can plot the user name is "John Doe" to html file.
   
```r
ui <- htmlTemplate(
  "ui_template.html",
  # You can pass dynamic values to the HTML template (if needed)
  user_name = "John Doe"
  # For example, passing a name from the server to the HTML
)
```

```html
<h1>Welcome, {{user_name}}</h1>
```

2. **Enhance with JavaScript**  
You can integrate JavaScript for added interactivity, such as handling dynamic content, animations, or integrating third-party libraries.

#### 3. Build the Server Logic Using {rhino} and Package Box

The server logic processes user interactions, handles inputs, and sends outputs. The `{rhino}` package simplifies this process, and you can organize the server logic using a modular approach.

1. **Define the Server Function**  
Write the server function to handle the logic behind your app. For example:

```r
server <- function(input, output, session) {
  observeEvent(input$submit, {
    name <- input$name
    output$greeting <- rhino::renderText({
      paste("Hello, ", name, "!", sep = "")
    })
  })
}
```

2. **Use Package Box for Modularization**  
You can modularize your app by using `box` for organizing different parts of your application (UI, server, and other functions) in separate files. This is especially helpful in larger applications.

```r
box::use(my_ui = "ui_file.R")
box::use(my_server = "server_file.R")
```

#### 4. Deploy the Application to shinyapps.io

Once your app is built and tested locally, you can deploy it to **shinyapps.io** for hosting.

1. **Install the `rsconnect` Package**  
Install the required package to deploy your app:

```r
install.packages("rsconnect")
```

2. **Authenticate with shinyapps.io**  
Before deployment, authenticate using your shinyapps.io account:

```r
rsconnect::setAccountInfo(name = 'your_account_name', token = 'your_token', secret = 'your_secret')
```

3. **Deploy the App**  
Once authenticated, deploy your application:

```r
rsconnect::deployApp("path/to/your/app")
```

This will upload and deploy your app to shinyapps.io, making it accessible online.

#### 3. Product Chain Tab

The **Product Chain** tab will focus on product-specific data, including supply chain metrics, inventory levels, and product movement over time.

With this setup, your dashboard will have three distinct tabs — **Overview**, **Sales Analyst**, and **Product Chain** — each providing interactive and dynamic content. By combining `{rhino}` for the UI, the **box** package for modularization, and deploying to **shinyapps.io**, you'll have a fully functional application.
